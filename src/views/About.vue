                I'm a person who doesn't like surprises and I know there are many other stubborn and particular people
                who are jsut the same way. However, we find ourselves surroudned by people who likes surprises and
                throwing parties in our honour without our input.

                With MerryMaker, the celebrant is the one who creates the event with their particulars. Through this,
                they can invite people to their cabal and view the details. A Celebrant can join many cabals and does
                not own the cabal since a lot of times, friend groups will have multiple celebrations.
