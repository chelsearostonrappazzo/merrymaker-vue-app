    <p>
      I'm a person who doesn't like surprises and I know there are many other stubborn and particular people who are
      jsut the same way. However, we find ourselves surroudned by people who likes surprises and throwing parties in our
      honour without our input.

      With MerryMaker, the celebrant is the one who creates the event with their particulars. Through this, they can
      invite people to their cabal and view the details. A Celebrant can join many cabals and does not own the cabal
      since a lot of times, friend groups will have multiple celebrations.
